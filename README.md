# tictactoe_game

This project implements a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It allows two players to take turns and play the game on a 3x3 grid. The project includes functions to initialize the game board, print the current state of the board, check for a winner or a draw, handle player moves, and run the main game loop.

Run the Script: 
Execute the Python script to initiate the game.

Play the Game: 
Follow the on-screen prompts to input moves for each player. The game board will be displayed after each move.

Win/Draw Conditions: 
The game will declare a winner if one player meets the winning criteria or announce a draw if no spaces are left.

This game is an excellent project for beginners to understand basic game logic, user input handling, and conditional statements in Python.
